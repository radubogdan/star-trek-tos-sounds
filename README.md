## Star Trek: TOS Sounds

### About 

Star Trek: TOS Sounds is a [FirefoxOS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) application made for fun. I was inspired by an application from Google Play called Star Trek Sounds,
but this one have only sounds from [The Original Series](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060028/).

I've used [Building Blocks](https://github.com/buildingfirefoxos/Building-Blocks) for this.
