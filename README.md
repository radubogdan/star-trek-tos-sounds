## Star Trek: TOS Sounds

### About 

Star Trek: TOS Sounds is a [FirefoxOS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) application made for fun. I was inspired by an application from Google Play called Star Trek Sounds,
but this one have only sounds from [The Original Series](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060028/).

I've used [Building Blocks](https://github.com/buildingfirefoxos/Building-Blocks) for this.

You can fork this project and contribute if you want.

### How to use this?

Using on your machine:

* Clone this and run a simple HTTP Server.

On your Firefox OS device:

* Check remote debugging from Developer Settings and 'Push' the application from the [Firefox OS Simulator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/)

__I will also upload this on my server so you can install of your FirefoxOS device.__
